Today Time Complexity and space complexity
Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
1.O-notation: Worst case senario OR upper bound
2. ‚Ñ¶-notation: Best Case senario OR Lower bound
3. ùöØ-notation: average time of a program.
Space Complexity : It is directly proportional to the largest memory your program acquires at any instance during run time.
Functions can be directly called. Where as, Methods are associated with objects.
